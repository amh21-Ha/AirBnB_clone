#Discription
This marks the initial phase in creating your inaugural web applicationâ€”the replica of Airbnb. The project's goal is to launch a duplicate of the Airbnb website using my server. The ultimate iteration of this endeavor will incorporate:

A command interpreter for data manipulation without a graphical interface, resembling a shell (for development and debugging).
A website (front-end) featuring both static and dynamic functionalities.
A thorough database to oversee the backend operations.
An API facilitating communication between the system's front-end and backend components.

# Aims & Objectives of this project

This will assist in effectively handling the entities within our project:
	Generating a new entity (e.g., a fresh "User" or a new "Place").
	Fetching an entity from a file storage, a database, etc.
	Executing operations on entities (e.g., counting, computing stats, etc.).
	Modifying attributes of an entity.
	Deleting an entity.
